# -Spooky-Binary-A-text-encryptor

There are 2 versions, 1 without an extra text file and 1 with. The one without has 2 very big "if/elif" blocks in it making the file a lot longer and larger. The 1 with 2 files has an extra .txt file that it pulls from to create a dictionary-like list (Because I didn't want a big file and also because I was too lazy to type a whole dictionary. I used a script to print all combinations of 6 bits and a corresponding character so I could use find/replace magic to make main code have a short algorithm).

Just do what the code prompts as there are no other needed instructions. You don't need to download any modules (unless from some odd reason you don't have the built in "string" module)
